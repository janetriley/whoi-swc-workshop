Seth is a geologist at the US Geological Survey.  He can't think of anything else interesting to write here. 

We only watch kids movies.  I've seen Cars2 twenty times in the last 6 months. Audrey pointed out that I should mention I have 2 little boys, I'm not just some huge Pixar fan (although they do make a good flix). 

You are most like the character TowMater
You're no Holly Shiftwell yourself.

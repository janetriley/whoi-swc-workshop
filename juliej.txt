This is Julie's Surf Report.

Tomorrow, Friday...

NH: 2.5ft @ 4.7s from 76 degrees...yay fun longboarding waves!  And offshore wind!  Well at least in the morning.
Outer Cape: Who knows the outer cape model is pretty dysfunctional.  Something like NH.  But there are sharks.
RI: Poor RI is gonna be small...1.1ft @5.7 seconds.  Not very useful surfing wise.  Go swimming!
